= ABOUT =
[http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/ pygpslog] is a GPS logger for S60 
smartphones that uses Nokia's internal location and landmarks API and
thus can co-exist with other navigation applications (e.g. Nokia Maps)
running at the same time.

It's features include
  * Record data in standard [http://www.topografix.com/GPX GPX] or [http://www.oziexplorer.com/ OziExplorer] format.
  * Easy marking of waypoints (with or without confirmation).
  * Easy marking of six different track segment types (e.g. speed limits).
  * The usual: Data view, Satellite View, Compass View...
  * Integration with Nokia's landmarks.

But best see the [README0#SCREENSHOTS Screenshots] below.

= WHAT'S NEW =
Please see the [History0 History] page.

= LICENSE =
  see [LICENSES] and [COPYING]

= REQUIREMENTS =
  * A device running S60 3rd edition.
  * An internal or external GPS device.
  * Python for S60, v1.4.2 or higher
  You may get it from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
  If you're new to Python on S60 it's probably better to read the
  [http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60 PyS60 Wiki] first.
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module (*see below!*).
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx Landmarks] module (*see below!*).

  * All installation files have to be [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed] by yourself in order to be really useful. Please see the [README0#INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION]

The !LocationRequestor module above is packaged with an UID that cannot be
used for Symbian's [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed]
process. Therefore I'm making a 
[http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/LocationReq_3rd_unsigned.sis re-packaged version]
available here.

Unfortunately, the Landmarks module, as of Mar. 7, 2008, contains a
few bugs that prevent it from working with pygpslog. Until I receive word
from the authors, you may download a [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/Landmarks_3rd_unsigned.sis patched version]
from this site.

In fact, the !LocationRequestor and Landmarks modules are not _absolutely_
required to run pygpslog, but the functionality will be severely limited.
Please see [README0#OPERATION below].

= CONTACT =
Please leave your comments on the [Contact] wiki page. I will be notified by
e-mail automagically ;-)

= INSTALLATION =
 # Install Python for S60 from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
 # If any old version of the !LocationRequestor or Landmarks modules are installed, please uninstall them
 # Get the [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/LocationReq_3rd_unsigned.sis LocationRequestor] module.
 # Get the [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/Landmarks_3rd_unsigned.sis Landmarks] module.
 # Get the [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?q=label:Featured latest version] of pygpslog.
 # If you're not yet, make yourself familiar with [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed]. The easiest way by now seems to be [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed Online].
 # Sign !LocationRequestor, Landmarks and !PyGpsLog. The capabilities required are `ReadUserData, WriteUserData, NetworkServices, LocalServices, UserEnvironment, ReadDeviceData, WriteDeviceData, Location` and `SwEvent`. See SymbianSigned.
 # Install to your device
 # Done!
 
Almost: I'd strongly recommend you to download, sign, and install those additional three modules:
 * [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyed/envy_3rd_1_0_4_unsigned.sis?download envy]. Read [http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=122897&highlight=envy this post] for a description.
 * [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/e32jext_unsigned.sis e32jext] from this site, and
 * [http://cyke64.googlepages.com/uitricks_unsigned.SIS uitricks] from [http://cyke64.googlepages.com cyke64's pys60 page].
 These three modules give you additional features like a CPU graph, more meaningful dialog menus and prevent pygpslog from being accidentally closed by pressing the red key.

I know the signing process is tedious, but this application requires `Location`
capabilities (`SwEvent` might be needed later). To make things worse,
Symbian Signed seems to be in the process of changing their signing procedures.
As of now (Mar. 7, 2008) you're not able to get your own developer certificate
without a valid Publisher ID. But please check yourself at
[https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed].

In the meantime I'll try to keep some SymbianSigned instructions [SymbianSigned updated].
Please feel free to comment and contribute.

If you _absolutely_ want to avoid Symbian Signed _and_ you have and _external
Bluetooth_ GPS device, you may skip the installation of !LocationRequestor and
Landmarks. In this case _you will not be able_ to share the GPS device
with other applications, and, you cannot use your phone's landmarks in any
way.

= OPERATION =
pygpslog can operate in three different modes. Each mode has it's advantages
and disadvantages. The default mode depends on what you installed during
the [#INSTALLATION installation process].

=== Location Requestor === 
(Preferred method, uses 3rd Party Python module)
==== Pro's: ====
 * GPS can be shared with other applications.
 * Very extensive data available.
 * Works with external or internal GPS devices.
 * Continues to work, even if Bluetooth connection is lost.
==== Con's: ====
 * Requires the [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module.
 * Must be Symbian signed

=== Generic NMEA over Bluetooth ===
==== Pro's: ====
 * Most extensive (and probably precise) data available.
 * Can be used without Symbian Signed.
 * No additional modules required.
==== Con's ===
 * Requires an external Bluetooth GPS.
 * GPS cannot be shared with Nokia Maps, Navigator, mgMaps or others.
 
=== Nokia Positioning === 
(uses standard Python module)
==== Pro's: ====
 * GPS can be shared with other applications.
 * Works with external or internal GPS devices.
 * No additional modules required.
==== Con's: ====
 * Severely limited data (no satellite info, ...).
 * Must be Symbian signed.
  
= USAGE =

=== Logging ===
They `'Yes'` (Green) key starts and stops the GPS logger. Every restart
creates a new log file in the [#SETTINGS configured] data directory (default:
`C:\Data\GpsLog`).

The `'C'` (Backspace) key pauses the logging operation.

Logging can be started automatically on program startup (see [#SETTINGS SETTINGS]).

=== Display Modes ===
Information display is only active if logging is switched on.

The left and right arrow key or the `'1'` and `'3'` keys switch back and forth
between the different modes.
 # Overview - Log File Name and General GPS
 # Compass and Speed
 # Landmarks
 # Satellite View
 # Power saving mode (logfile writing only)

The `'2'` key switches the application in full screen mode. This especially
usefull in night mode.

Night mode and day mode can be toggled with the `'0'` key. Night mode will
be automatically active the the application is started after 7pm or before
5am (should be 9am, but nevermind ;-) )

In idle (non-logging) mode, GPS-data display can be toggled on and off using
the `'Select'` (or `'Enter'`) key.

=== Waypoints ===
The `'#'` key inserts a waypoint into the log file. Currently, this is done
by inserting a named trackpoint into the GPX file. For !OziExplorer files,
this doesn't have any effect in this version.

If the Landmarks module is [#INSTALLATION installed], and the option is
[#Landmark_Settings activated], a Nokia landmark is added.

=== Track Segments ===
There are six different segment types. Their default names are:
`"Speed 30", "Speed 50", "Speed 60", "Speed 70", "Speed 80"` and `"Speed 100"`.
(This will be configurable in the future).

The segments are activated by pressing one of the number keys from `'4'` to `'9'`.
To end a segment press the same key agein or press the '`*'`-key.

If you press a different key from `'4'` to `'9'` while a segment is active,
the current segment will be closed and a new segment opened.

If the Landmarks module is [#INSTALLATION installed], and the option is
[#Landmark_Settings activated], a Nokia landmark is added, that marks the
center between the start and the end of the segment and has a coverage
radius of half the distance.


= SETTINGS =
== General ==
== Landmarks ==
The landmark settings are only available if the Landmarks module is [#INSTALLATION installed].

= TROUBLESHOOTING =
== Known Problems ==
 * When using an external Bluetooth GPS, logfiles are closed, if the Bluetooth connection is lost.
 * Landmark display eats *a lot* of CPU time and battery. It's has been improved by using a cache.
 * _A lot_ of unhandled exceptions... Most of them will only be visible on program close.

== FAQ ==
 * Q: When I try to start PyGpsLog, nothing happens.
 * A: Try to install PyGpsLog to the same drive as your Python installation.
