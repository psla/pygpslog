= Symbian Signed =

The status of the Symbian Signed Process seems to be a little unclear by now,
to say the least. So here's what I'm trying to get my applications signed without
using my old developer certificate. If you want to follow the ongoing discussions,
go to http://discussion.forum.nokia.com or http://developer.symbian.com/forum/forum.jspa?forumID=2 .

= !PyGpsLog =

What I'm doing by now is to go to [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed Online],
fill out the form for all three required SIS files - and wait...

It's important, that you use the
[http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/LocationReq_3rd_unsigned.sis LocationRequestor] and
[http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/Landmarks_3rd_unsigned.sis Landmarks] module from this
site, because the original files cannot be signed with their present UIDs.
