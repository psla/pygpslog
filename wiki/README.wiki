= ABOUT =
[http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/ pygpslog] is a GPS logger for S60 
smartphones that uses Nokia's internal location and landmarks API and
thus can co-exist with other navigation applications (e.g. Nokia Maps)
running at the same time.

It's features include
  * Record data in standard [http://www.topografix.com/GPX GPX] or [http://www.oziexplorer.com/ OziExplorer] format.
  * Easy marking of waypoints (with or without confirmation).
  * Easy marking of six different track segment types (e.g. speed limits).
  * The usual: Data view, Satellite View, Compass View...
  * Integration with Nokia's landmarks.

But best see the [README#SCREENSHOTS Screenshots] below.

= WHAT'S NEW =
Please see the [History] page.

= LICENSE =
  see [LICENSES] and [COPYING]

= REQUIREMENTS =
  * A device running S60 3rd edition.
  * An internal or external GPS device.
  * Python for S60, v1.4.2 or higher
  You may get it from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
  If you're new to Python on S60 it's probably better to read the
  [http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60 PyS60 Wiki] first.
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module (*see below!*).
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx Landmarks] module (*see below!*).

  * All installation files have to be [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed] by yourself in order to be really useful. Please see the [README#INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION]

The !LocationRequestor module above is packaged with an UID that cannot be
used for Symbian's [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed]
process. Therefore I'm making a 
[http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ARecommended+LocationRequestor re-packaged version]
available here.

Unfortunately, the Landmarks module, as of Mar. 7, 2008, contains a
few bugs that prevent it from working with pygpslog. Until I receive word
from the authors, you may download a
[http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ARecommended+Landmarks patched version]
from this site.

In fact, the !LocationRequestor and Landmarks modules are not _absolutely_
required to run pygpslog, but the functionality will be severely limited.
Please see [README#OPERATION below].

= CONTACT =
Please leave your comments on the [Contact] wiki page. I will be notified by
e-mail automagically ;-)

= INSTALLATION =
 # Install Python for S60 from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
 # If any old version of the !LocationRequestor or Landmarks modules are installed, please uninstall them
 # Get the [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ARecommended+LocationRequestor LocationRequestor] module.
 # Get the [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ARecommended+Landmarks Landmarks] module.
 # Get the [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?q=label:Featured latest version] of pygpslog.
 # If you're not yet, make yourself familiar with [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed]. The easiest way by now seems to be [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed Online].
 # Sign !LocationRequestor, Landmarks and !PyGpsLog. The capabilities required are `ReadUserData, WriteUserData, NetworkServices, LocalServices, UserEnvironment, ReadDeviceData, WriteDeviceData, Location` and `SwEvent`. See SymbianSigned.
 # Install to your device
 # Done!
 
Almost: I'd strongly recommend you to download, sign, and install those additional three modules:
 * [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyed/envy_3rd_1_0_4_unsigned.sis?download envy]. Read [http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=122897&highlight=envy this post] for a description.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ARecommended+e32jext e32jext] from this site, and
 * [http://uikludges.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uikludges.SIS uikludges] from [http://code.google.com/p/uikludges/].
 These three modules give you additional features like a CPU graph, more meaningful dialog menus and prevent pygpslog from being accidentally closed by pressing the red key.

I know the signing process is tedious, but this application requires `Location`
capabilities (`SwEvent` might be needed later). To make things worse,
Symbian Signed seems to be in the process of changing their signing procedures.
As of now (Mar. 7, 2008) you're not able to get your own developer certificate
without a valid Publisher ID. But please check yourself at
[https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed].

In the meantime I'll try to keep some SymbianSigned instructions [SymbianSigned updated].
Please feel free to comment and contribute.

If you _absolutely_ want to avoid Symbian Signed _and_ you have and _external
Bluetooth_ GPS device, you may skip the installation of !LocationRequestor and
Landmarks. In this case _you will not be able_ to share the GPS device
with other applications, and, you cannot use your phone's landmarks in any
way.

= OPERATION =
pygpslog can operate in three different modes. Each mode has it's advantages
and disadvantages. The default mode depends on what you installed during
the [#INSTALLATION installation process].

=== Location Requestor === 
(Preferred method, uses 3rd Party Python module)
==== Pro's: ====
 * GPS can be shared with other applications.
 * Very extensive data available.
 * Works with external or internal GPS devices.
 * Continues to work, even if Bluetooth connection is lost.
==== Con's: ====
 * Requires the [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module.
 * Must be Symbian signed

=== Generic NMEA over Bluetooth ===
==== Pro's: ====
 * Most extensive (and probably precise) data available.
 * Can be used without Symbian Signed.
 * No additional modules required.
==== Con's ===
 * Requires an external Bluetooth GPS.
 * GPS cannot be shared with Nokia Maps, Navigator, mgMaps or others.
 
=== Nokia Positioning === 
(uses standard Python module)
==== Pro's: ====
 * GPS can be shared with other applications.
 * Works with external or internal GPS devices.
 * No additional modules required.
==== Con's: ====
 * Severely limited data (no satellite info, ...).
 * Must be Symbian signed.
  
= USAGE =

=== Logging ===
The `'Yes'` (Green) key starts and stops the GPS logger. Every restart
creates a new log file in the [#SETTINGS configured] data directory (default:
`C:\Data\GpsLog` or `E:\Data\GpsLog`).

The `'C'` (Backspace) key pauses the logging operation.

Logging can be started automatically on program startup (see [#SETTINGS SETTINGS]).

!PyGpsLog can store it's log files in two different formats:
===== GPX =====
[http://www.topografix.com/GPX GPX] is a format used by a
[http://www.topografix.com/gpx_resources.asp lot of devices and applications], including
[http://earth.google.com GoogleEarth], and can be easily manipulated.
Additionally, !PyGpsLog uses it's [Screenshots#Extended_Format own extensions]
to store additional data for later analysis.
===== !OziExplorer =====
[http://www.oziexplorer.com/ OziExplorer] is a powerful GPS mapping software. The format
used for their `.plt` track files is very compact and by
[Screenshots#OziExplorer far enough] to store basic trackpoint data.

So, if you're low on memory use this format.

===== GPSBabel =====
One word for [http://www.gpsbabel.org/ GPSBabel]: Depending on the information you need,
it doesn't really matter which format you use. You can alway use
[http://www.gpsbabel.org/ GPSBabel] to convert from one format into almost any other.

From [http://www.gpsbabel.org/downloads.html version 1.3.5 beta] on, GPSBabel can
create Nokia LMX landmark files that can be sent via Bluetooth to your device. So I'm
using it to create my Landmarks in !GoogleEarth, convert them to LMX and send them
to my E65.

=== Waypoints ===
The `'#'` key inserts a waypoint into the log file. Currently, this is done
by inserting a named trackpoint into the GPX file. For !OziExplorer files,
this doesn't have any effect in this version.

If the Landmarks module is [#INSTALLATION installed], and the option is
[#Landmarks activated], a Nokia landmark with the current time stamp
is added.

=== Track Segments ===
There are six different segment types. Their default names are:
`"Speed 30", "Speed 50", "Speed 60", "Speed 70", "Speed 80"` and `"Speed 100"`.
(This will be configurable in the future).

The segments are activated by pressing one of the number keys from `'4'` to `'9'`.
To end a segment press the same key again or press the '`*'`-key.

If you press a different key from `'4'` to `'9'` while a segment is active,
the current segment will be closed and a new segment opened.

If the Landmarks module is [#INSTALLATION installed], and the option is
[#Landmarks activated], a Nokia landmark is added, that marks the
center between the start and the end of the segment, has a coverage
radius of half the distance and intersects the end points.

=== Display Modes ===
To save battery, information display is usually only active if logging is switched on.

You can switch on GPS information in idle mode by pressing the `'Select'` key (or
`'Enter'` key, joystick button).

The left and right arrow key or the `'1'` and `'3'` keys switch back and forth
between the different modes.
 # Overview - Log File Name and General GPS
 # Compass and Speed
 # Landmarks (if [#INSTALLATION installed])
 # Satellite View
 # Power saving mode (log file writing only)

The `'2'` key switches the application in full screen mode. This especially
useful in night mode.

Night and day mode can be toggled with the `'0'` key. Night mode will
be automatically active the the application is started after 7pm or before
5am (should be 9am, but never mind ;-) )

The `'C'` (Backspace) key also freezes the GPS display.

=== Destination ===
!PyGpsLog provides a simple way of navigating, a little bit like Nokia's
own Navigator application.

The `Destination` menu allows you to select a destination, either from your
landmarks (if [#INSTALLATION installed]) or as decimal coordinates.

Once a destination is selected it's distance and estimated arrival time is shown
on the Overview and Compass pages. In the landmarks list it will be shown on top.

On the Compass and Satellite pages there will be two dot helping you navigate.
A *blue* marker shows the absolute heading and a *red* marker will show heading
relative to your current heading (or view direction, when going forward).

= SETTINGS =
== General ==
 * *Keep Backlight On*: Keeps the devices' backlight on while logging or GPS display is active. Default: *off*.
 * *Start automatically*: Start a new log file when the application is started. Default: *off*.
 * *Altitude Correction*: Calibrates your altitude. Please check, when using [#Location_Requestor LocationRequestor] or [#Nokia_Positioning Nokia Positioning]. Default: *0*.
 * *Output Directory*: Log file directory. Default *`C:\Data\GpsLog`* (or *`E:\Data\GpsLog`*, if a memory card is installed).
 * *Log Format*: `GPX` or `OziExplorer`. Default: *GPX*.
 * *Min. Distance to Record*: The minimum distance in meters you have to travel, before a new trackpoint is inserted. Default: *25* m.
 * *Max. Distance per GPS interval*: Greater jumps will be regarded as incorrect data and discarded. Increase this value in an airplane. Default: *80* m.
 * *Extended Data Format*: Logs [Screenshots#Extended_Format additional data] (like HDOP, VDOP, number of satellites and fix type in GPX format or formatted time in !OziExplorer format). Default: *on*.
 * *Log Satellites*: Log [Screenshots#Satellite_Info detailed satellite data] (in extended GPX format only). Turn this off, if you're low on memory. Default: *on*.
 * *Choose new Bluetooth device*: Set this to `on` to choose a new external Bluetooth device, next time you start logging. If you [#INSTALLATION signed] the application or the [#INSTALLATION LocationRequestor module] is installed, you can choose your [#OPERATION operating mode] here. Default: Depends on your [#INSTALLATION installation].
 * *Show CPU Usage*: Show the CPU meter for this application. Only available if the [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ARecommended+e32jext e32jext] module is [#INSTALLATION installed]. Default: *on*.
 * *Show Battery Meter in Fullscreen*: Default: *on*.
 * *Reset to default settings*: Application will exit after resetting.

== Landmarks ==
The landmark settings are only available if the Landmarks module is [#INSTALLATION installed].

 * *Store Waypoints as Landmarks*: Default: *on*.
 * *Edit New Landmarks*: Let's you edit or delete landmarks after insertion. Default: *on*.
 * *Category for Waypoints*: New [#Waypoints waypoints] will be assigned this category by default. Default: *(None)*.
 * *Store Markers as Landmarks*: Inserts a landmark for [#Track_Segments track segment] markers. Default: *on*.
 * *Landmark Search Radius*: Landmarks further away will not be displayed on the landmarks page. Increasing this may _significantly_ slow down the application. Default: *10* km.
 * *Notify Near Category*: Shows a notification (no audio yet) when you reach landmarks of a this category. Default: *(None)*.
 * *Distance for Notification*: Show the notification when closer. Default: *25* m
 * *Update Interval*: Refresh the landmarks page only after this interval. Default: *3* sec.
 * *Use Small Icons*: Default: *off*.
 
These settings are for experimental features:
 * *Show Nokia Icons*: Shows a listbox with Nokia's own landmark icons instead of the internal ones. Default: *off*.

The options menu of the landmarks settings page contains one important menu item:
 * *Set Icons/Categories*: This inserts the default Categories in Nokias landmarks database and sets the icons for Landmarks in these categories. *Repeat this step* if you imported landmarks from another device or PC.

The other menu items are still in an experimental stage, and landmark category filtering doesn't work properly yet.

Since version 0.2.1, there is also the possibility to add [UserIcons user defined icon sets],
for new landmark categories or non-english versions of S60.

= TROUBLESHOOTING =
== Known Problems ==
 * When using an external Bluetooth GPS, logfiles are closed, if the Bluetooth connection is lost.
 * Landmark display eats *a lot* of CPU time and battery. It's has been improved by using a cache.
 * Landmark category filtering is still incomplete.
 * _A lot_ of unhandled exceptions... Most of them will only be visible on program close.

== FAQ ==
 * Q: When I try to start PyGpsLog, nothing happens.
 * A: Try to install PyGpsLog to the same drive as your Python installation.
 
 * Q: There are no icons on the landmarks page.
 * A: Only icons for internally know categories will be shown. To do this go to Settings->Landmarks->Options->Set Icons/Categories.
