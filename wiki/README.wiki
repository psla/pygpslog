= ABOUT =
[http://code.google.com/p/pysgpslog/ pygpslog] is a GPS logger for S60 
smartphones that uses Nokia's internal location and landmarks API and
thus can co-exist with other navigation applications (e.g. Nokia Maps)
running at the same time.

= LICENSE =
  see [LICENSES] and [COPYING]

= REQUIREMENTS =
  * A device running S60 3rd edition.
  * An internal or external GPS device.
  * Python for S60, v1.4.2 or higher
  You may get it from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
  If you're new to Python on S60 it's probably better to read the
  [http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60 PyS60 Wiki] first.
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module.
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx Landmarks] module (*see below!*).

  * All installation files have to be [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed] by yourself with a developer certificate in order to be really useful. Please see the [README#DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTATION]

Unfortunately, the Landmarks module, as of Mar. 3, 2008, contains a
few bugs that prevent it from working with pygpslog. Until I receive word
from the authors, you may download a [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/Landmarks-3rd-unsigned.sis patched version]
from this site.

In fact, the !LocationRequestor and Landarks modules are not_absolutely_
required to run pygpslog, but the functionality will be severely limited.
Please see [README#OPERATION below].

= INSTALLATION =
 # Install Python for S60 from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
 # Get the [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module.
 # Get the [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/Landmarks-3rd-unsigned.sis Landmarks] module.
 # Get the [http://code.google.com/p/pygpslog/downloads/list latest version] of pygpslog.
 # If you're not yet, make yourself familiar with [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed] and get a DevCert.
 # Sign !LocationRequestor, Landmarks and PyGpsLog. The capabilities required are `ReadUserData, WriteUserData, NetworkServices, LocalServices, UserEnvironment, Location` and `SwEvent`.
 # Install to your device
 # Done!
  
I know the signing process is tedious, but this application requires `Location`
capabilities (`SwEvent` might be needed later).

If you _absolutely_ want to avoid Symbian Signed _and_ you have and _external
Bluetooth_ GPS device, you may skip the installation of !LocationRequestor and
Landmarks. In this case _you will not be able_ to share the GPS device
with other applications, and, you cannot use your phone's landmarks in any
way.

= OPERATION =
pygpslog can operate in three different modes. Each mode has it's advantages
and disadvantages. The default mode depends on what you installed during
the [#INSTALLATION installation process].

=== Generic NMEA over Bluetooth ===
==== Pro's: ====
 * Most extensive (and probably precise) data available.
 * Low CPU usage and battery drainage.
 * Can be used without Symbian Signed.
 * No additional modules required
==== Con's ===
 * GPS cannot be shared with Nokia Maps, Navigator, mgMaps or others.
