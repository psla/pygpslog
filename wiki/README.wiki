= ABOUT =
[http://code.google.com/p/pysgpslog/ pygpslog] is a GPS logger that uses Nokia's internal location and landmarks API and thus can co-operate with other navigation applications running at the same time.

= LICENSE =
  see [LICENSES] and [COPYING]

= REQUIREMENTS =
  * A device running S60 3rd edition.
  * An internal or external GPS device.
  * Python for S60, v1.4.2 or higher
  You may get it from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 SourceForge].
  If you're new to Python on S60 it's probably better to read the
  [http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60 PyS60 Wiki] first.
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx LocationRequestor] module.
  * The [http://www.iyouit.eu/portal/Software.aspx Landmarks] module (*see below!*).

  * All installation files have to be [https://www.symbiansigned.com Symbian Signed] by yourself with a developer certificate in order to be really useful. Please see the [README#DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTATION]

Unfortunately, the Landmarks module, as of Mar. 3, 2008, contains a few bugs that prevent
it from working with pygpslog. Until I receive word from the authors, you may download
a [http://pygpslog.googlecode.com/files/Landmarks-3rd-unsigned.sis patched version] from this site.

In fact, the !LocationRequestor and Landarks modules are not _absolutely_ required to
run pygpslog, but the functionality will be severly limited. Please see below.
