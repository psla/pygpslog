#summary Howto create user defined icon sets.

= Why =

Python for S60 doesn't have the option (yet) to use S60 icon files (in
.mif or .mbm format, for you experts out there) for drawing the graphics
in them.

So, finding the pure text landmarks list a little bit dull, i created some
JPEG files to be displayed on the list. Unfortunately, those icons don't
really match Nokia's but so what...

The next problem is that the pre-installed icons and category names probably
don't match the names on your non-English device.

= How =

=== The Landmarks List ===

This is fairly simple. All you need is a JPEG or PNG file with your icons and
their transparency masks. Icons and their masks must be 64 x 64 pixels in size,
each row of the image contains two pairs of mask and icon. Masks may either be
black and white or gray scale, with white marking the opaque parts. It should
look like this:

You then need a definition file to describe the categories for the icons. Suppose you
name the above JPEG `'myicons.jpg'` you will have a definition file `'myicons.def'`
(the name _must_ end with `'.def'`), that looks like this:

{{{
ICONFILE   = "myicons.jpg"
ICONDEF    = [ "Accomodation",  "Businesses",    "Telecommunicat.",
               "Education",     "Entertainment", "Food & drink",
               "Geographical locat.", "Outdoor activities", "People",
               "Public services", "Places of worship", "Shopping",
               "Sightseeing", "Sports", "Transport", "User" ]
}}}

You simply create a directory `'icons'` in your log file directory (see
[README#SETTINGS SETTINGS]), using your favorite S60 file manager or Bluetooth tool,
and copy the two files there. Voil√†!
